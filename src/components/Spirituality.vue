      <h1>SPIRITUALITY</h1>
      <p>Prayer is the simple act of having a conversation with God. It’s about talking with the Creator of the
        Universe: whether aloud or in our thoughts, during special or ordinary moments, when we’re on the move or
        before we go to bed. It’s the privilege we get as His children—a direct connection to God. No voicemail
        messages, no call waiting.</p>

          <h2>Many have tried to determine what constitutes the essential human endeavor. For some it is to be known
            and for others it is to be loved. For many it is to make a lasting mark on the world so that the impact of
            ones life continues to have significance.</h2>
          <p>At the heart of each pursuit is the sense that human life, no matter how frail or fleeting, is of great
            value and this value is appreciated when one life becomes truly aware of another.
          </p>
          <p>Every heart wants to be cherished, every mind understood and every voice heard.
          </p>
          <p>In the pages of Holy Scripture we hear God saying, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you” and “I
            have loved you with an everlasting love” and we realize that we are known more completely and loved more
            deeply by our Creator than in any human experience.
          </p>
          <p>It is divine love.
          </p>
          <p>Although not every gesture of love demands a response, our Creator loves us and then invites us to
            respond.
          </p>
          <p>What response does God want to divine love?
          </p>
          <p>God wants to be known and to be loved. Moreover, God wants to live in our hearts but this invitation must
            come from us. Ultimately God wants to make an imprint on our lives that will last for eternity.
          </p>
          <p>You are invited to discover for yourself the rich resources that Seventh-day Adventists have found on the
            journey in response to God’s invitation.</p>

      <h2>Even though “I’m too busy!” has become the catch phrase of the twenty-first century, which is often “a boast
        disguised as a complaint”[1], scientists are discovering that we perform better and achieve more if we take a
        break[2], [3].</h2>
      <hr /><br/>
      <p>Seventh-day Adventists believe God gave us the secret to performing our best when He asked us to, “Remember
        the Sabbath day . . . on [the seventh day] you shall not do any work” (Exodus 20:8-10).</p>
      <p>For Adventists like Natalie Nawaikalou, Sabbath is the day they look forward to all week. “It’s the day when I
        don't have to get up at 5 a.m. and rush off to work, consumed by traffic and busyness,” says Natalie
        Nawaikalou, a full-time primary teacher who spends three hours each day commuting for work. “It is the day I
        can take as much time to hang out with God, His Word, His creation and His people, and not feel guilty because
        I'm not off doing something else I'm supposed to.”</p>
      <p>Every week, Adventists have a special date with God—a guilt-free break from work and a whole day to deepen our
        friendship with the Creator of the universe.
